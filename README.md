# 🔍 Recommendation System with PySpark

This project implements a recommendation system for a **movie and series streaming platform** using the **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** algorithm with **Apache Spark** (via **PySpark**), focused on offering personalized recommendations based on user rating data.

## 📌 Objective

Develop a scalable recommendation system using **PySpark**, based on the **ALS (Alternating Least Squares)** algorithm, capable of predicting affinity between users and items. The project includes an interactive web interface for testing and demonstrations, built with the **Gradio** library.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- `PySpark`  
- `ALS (Alternating Least Squares)`  
- `Gradio` (web interface)  
- `Pandas`  
- `Matplotlib`  
- `Google Colab / SparkSession`

## 🛠️ Project Stages

### 1. 📦 Import and Initial Setup
- Configuration of SparkSession  
- Loading essential libraries  

### 2. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
- Reading the ratings dataset (user, item, rating)  
- Conversion to `Spark DataFrame`  

### 3. 🤖 ALS Model Training and Results 🔍

- **Algorithm used:** ALS (Alternating Least Squares)  
- **Number of observations:** ~100,000 records  
- **Train/test split:** 80% / 20%  
- **Best hyperparameters found via Cross-Validation:**  
  - Rank: 40  
  - MaxIter: 10  
  - RegParam: 0.05  
- **Mean error (RMSE) on test set:** 3.61  

🔧 📈 The model achieved an RMSE of 3.61, considering a rating scale from 1 to 10.  
This error indicates intermediate performance, with room for some improvements.  
Even without using additional information about users and items, ALS managed to capture relevant recommendation patterns.

## 💼 Estimated Financial Impact

This scalable recommendation system, developed with PySpark and ALS, processed around 100,000 ratings to offer personalized recommendations.

Considering a simulated scenario:

- **Active customer base:** 50,000  
- **Average annual revenue per customer:** R$ 2,000 (≈ $400)  
- **Current retention rate:** 70%  
- **Potential retention increase with personalized recommendations:** 12% (over the retained base)

### Impact calculation:

1. Customers currently retained:  
   50,000 × 70% = 35,000 customers

2. Additional customers retained with recommendations:  
   35,000 × 12% = 4,200 customers

3. Additional annual revenue:  
   4,200 × R$ 2,000 = **R$ 8,400,000 (≈ $1,680,000)**

**Results**
- Additional customers retained: 4,200  
- Estimated additional revenue: R$ 8,400,000 (≈ $1,680,000)  

These numbers demonstrate the potential **financial impact of personalized recommendations** on customer retention and revenue.

### 4. 🎯 Recommendation Generation
- Use of the `.transform()` method to apply the model to new data  
- Sorting predictions by affinity score (`prediction`)  
- **Affinity Score** grouped by ID to return the customer's propensity to purchase a given item based on affinity score  

### 5. 🌐 Interactive Interface
- Creation of the function `fazer_recomendacao(user_id)` to predict the items most likely to appeal  
- Implementation of a `Gradio` interface  
- Input: User ID  
- Output: Top-N personalized recommendations

## 🧠 Next Steps

- Add content filters based on categories  
- Integration with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
